# Statutory Curriculum Sources

## Purpose
This directory defines **authoritative statutory curriculum sources** used to anchor all curriculum, lesson generation, and AI outputs to official government guidance.

These sources act as the **legal and pedagogical ground truth** for LetsRevise.

## What belongs here
Only **official, government or regulator-issued curriculum frameworks**, for example:
- Department for Education (DfE) National Curriculum
- GCSE / A-Level subject content specifications
- Exam board statutory requirements (AQA, OCR, Edexcel, etc.)

No teacher-created schemes or third-party interpretations live here.

## Governance rules
- Sources are **versioned** and **date-stamped**
- Each source must declare:
  - Jurisdiction (e.g. UK)
  - Authority (e.g. Department for Education)
  - Applicable stages (KS1–KS4, GCSE, A-Level)
- Changes are additive; historical versions are never deleted

## How these sources are used
Statutory sources:
1. Constrain curriculum specs
2. Validate curriculum → lesson mappings
3. Inform AI prompt grounding
4. Provide auditability for teachers and regulators

AI output **must never contradict** statutory sources.

## Update policy
Updates occur only when:
- Government guidance changes
- Exam board specifications are revised

Each update should be reviewed and committed explicitly.

## Non-goals
- This directory does NOT contain lesson content
- This directory does NOT contain pedagogy or teaching style
- This directory does NOT contain AI prompts

It defines **what must be taught**, not **how it is taught**.
