/**
 * validate-lesson-bundle.ts
 *
 * Design-time utility scaffold for validating Lesson Plan Bundle JSON
 * files against the canonical schema in:
 *   docs/curriculum/lesson-plan-bundle.schema.json
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - This file is a placeholder in the current phase.
 * - It intentionally contains no runtime logic yet.
 * - When implemented, it should:
 *   - Load the JSON schema from docs/curriculum/lesson-plan-bundle.schema.json
 *   - Validate a bundle file passed via CLI arguments
 *   - Exit with a non-zero code on validation errors
 *
 * No schema, access control, or AI behaviour should be modified here.
