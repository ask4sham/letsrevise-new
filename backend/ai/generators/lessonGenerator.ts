/**
 * backend/ai/generators/lessonGenerator.ts
 *
 * Phase H scaffold only – no AI logic.
 *
 * This file is reserved for a future Lesson Generator implementation that:
 * - Takes a Curriculum Topic + constraints as input (see:
 *   docs/curriculum/curriculum-spec.schema.json and
 *   docs/curriculum/curriculum-to-lesson.contract.md)
 * - Produces a Lesson Plan Bundle that validates against:
 *   docs/curriculum/lesson-plan-bundle.schema.json
 *
 * HARD BOUNDARIES (current phase):
 * - No calls to AI providers.
 * - No runtime usage from request handlers or workers.
 * - No access to user data, entitlements, or subscriptions.
 * - No mutations of Lesson or Curriculum documents.
 *
 * Until a later phase is explicitly activated, this file must remain
 * documentation-only or contain pure types/interfaces with no side effects.
