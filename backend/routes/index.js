// Backend routes registry (documentation-only helper file).
// AI Generation Jobs routes are part of the overall backend route namespace
// for groundwork only: the public `/api/ai-generation-jobs` and admin
// `/api/admin/ai-generation-jobs` mounts exist to stabilise the API surface,
// but their underlying routers are placeholders with no handlers. Inclusion
// in this registry does not imply active functionality or execution logic.
