# Algebra - Revision Notes

## Overview
Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In GCSE Maths, Algebra enables us to solve equations, work with formulas, and understand relationships between quantities. This is a key area for your AQA GCSE Maths exam and a crucial building block for further study in Maths and other sciences.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use algebraic notation.
- Simplify and manipulate algebraic expressions.
- Solve linear and quadratic equations.
- Understand and use sequences and series.
- Formulate and solve problems using algebra.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- **Algebraic Expression:** A combination of variables, numbers, and at least one arithmetic operation.
- **Equation:** A statement that two expressions are equal.
- **Variable:** A symbol that represents an unknown value.
- **Coefficient:** The numerical factor of a term that contains a variable.
- **Linear Equation:** An equation where the highest power of the variable is 1.
- **Quadratic Equation:** An equation where the highest power of the variable is 2.

## Detailed Explanations
1. **Simplifying Expressions:** Combine like terms. For example, 3x + 5x = 8x.
2. **Solving Equations:** Use inverse operations to isolate the variable. For example, for 5x = 20, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 4.
3. **Expanding Brackets:** Apply the distributive law. For example, 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6.

## Worked Examples
1. **Solving a linear equation:** Solve 3x - 2 = 4.
   - Add 2 to both sides: 3x = 6.
   - Divide by 3: x = 2.
2. **Solving a quadratic equation:** Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.
   - Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0.
   - Set each factor equal to zero and solve: x = 2, x = 3.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- **Incorrectly combining terms:** Make sure the terms have the same variable and exponent.
- **Forgetting to distribute:** Always distribute a number outside a bracket to every term inside the bracket.
- **Incorrectly solving equations:** Remember to use inverse operations to isolate the variable.

## Exam Techniques & Tips
- **Show your working:** AQA examiners look for clear working out, even if the final answer is incorrect.
- **Check your work:** Check your solutions, particularly in algebraic manipulation and solving equations.
- **Practice, practice, practice:** The more you practice different types of algebra problems, the better prepared you will be.

## Practice Questions
1. Simplify 4x + 2x. (Foundation)
2. Solve 3x + 4 = 10. (Foundation)
3. Expand 2(x + 3). (Intermediate)
4. Solve x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0. (Intermediate)
5. The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is 51. Find the numbers. (Challenge)
