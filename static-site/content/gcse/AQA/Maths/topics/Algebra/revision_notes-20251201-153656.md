# Algebra - Revision Notes

## Overview
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and rules to describe relationships between quantities. It forms the foundation for advanced studies in many fields, including engineering, medicine, and economics. Algebra is a vital part of the GCSE Maths curriculum and is essential to understand for AQA exams.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this revision session, you should be able to:
1. Understand and apply the fundamental principles of algebra.
2. Solve equations and inequalities.
3. Manipulate algebraic expressions.
4. Understand and apply sequences and their application.
5. Apply algebraic skills to solve real-world problems.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- **Variable:** A symbol (often a letter) that represents an unknown number.
- **Coefficient:** A number used to multiply a variable.
- **Equation:** A mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions.
- **Inequality:** A relation between two expressions that may not be equal.
- **Expression:** A mathematical phrase that combines numbers and/or variables.
- **Sequence:** An ordered list of numbers.

## Detailed Explanations

### Variables and Coefficients
Variables and coefficients are fundamental to algebra. For example, in the expression 5x, '5' is the coefficient and 'x' is the variable. 

### Solving Equations
To solve an equation means to find the value of the variable. For example, to solve the equation 2x = 10, we divide both sides by 2, to find x = 5.

### Manipulating Expressions
This involves adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing terms within an algebraic expression. For example, to simplify the expression 3x + 2x, we add the coefficients to get 5x.

## Worked Examples
1. **Problem:** Solve the equation 3x = 12.
   **Solution:** Divide both sides by 3 to get x = 4.

2. **Problem:** Simplify the expression 2x + 3x - 5.
   **Solution:** Combine like terms to get 5x - 5.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- **Incorrectly combining like terms:** Remember, you can only combine terms that have the exact same variable and exponent.
- **Mistakes in sign:** When manipulating expressions, be careful with the signs.

## Exam Techniques & Tips
- **Answer the question:** It sounds simple, but make sure you answer the question that has been asked, not the one you wish had been asked.
- **Check your work:** Always check your work for careless mistakes.
- **Practice:** The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll be with different types of problems.

## Practice Questions
1. Solve the equation 5x = 15. (Foundation)
2. Simplify the expression 3x + 2x - 4. (Foundation)
3. Solve the inequality 2x > 8. (Intermediate)
4. Simplify the expression 4(x - 3) + 2x. (Intermediate)
5. What is the next term in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, ...? (Challenge)
