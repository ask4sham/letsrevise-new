# Cells - Revision Notes

## Overview
Cells are the building blocks of all living organisms. They are the smallest unit of life and contain various structures, known as organelles, that perform different functions to keep an organism alive. In GCSE Science, understanding the structure and functions of cells is crucial as it forms the basis for many other topics in biology.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure and function of different organelles within a cell
- Distinguish between animal and plant cells
- Understand the process of cell division (mitosis)
- Know the basics of cell specialisation and differentiation
- Understand how substances move in and out of cells

## Key Concepts & Definitions

- **Cell:** The smallest unit of life, containing various structures that carry out specific functions.
- **Organelle:** A specialised structure within a cell that performs a specific function.
- **Nucleus:** The control centre of a cell, it contains DNA which determines the characteristics of the cell.
- **Mitochondria:** Organelles that provide energy for the cell through the process of respiration.
- **Cell Membrane:** The barrier that controls what enters and exits a cell.
- **Cytoplasm:** A jelly-like substance where most of the cell's activities take place.

## Detailed Explanations

**1. Cell Structure & Function**
Animal and plant cells share many common features such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, a large permanent vacuole and chloroplasts.

**2. Cell Division (Mitosis)**
Cells divide through a process called mitosis. This process is essential for growth and repair of tissues.

**3. Cell Specialisation & Differentiation**
Cell differentiation is the process by which a cell changes to become specialised for its job. This process allows cells to carry out specific functions in the body.

**4. Movement of Substances**
Substances can move in and out of cells through diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.

## Worked Examples

**1. Cell Structure**
Problem: Identify the organelles labelled in a diagram of an animal cell.
Solution: Label 1 - nucleus, label 2 - mitochondria, label 3 - cell membrane, label 4 - cytoplasm.

**2. Cell Division**
Problem: Explain the importance of mitosis.
Solution: Mitosis is important for growth and repair in the body. It allows cells to replicate and produce identical copies which can replace damaged or dead cells.

**3. Movement of Substances**
Problem: How does water move in and out of cells?
Solution: Water moves in and out of cells by osmosis. This is the movement of water from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration through a partially permeable membrane.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

**1. Confusing plant and animal cells:** Remember that plant cells have additional structures - a cell wall, a large vacuole and chloroplasts.

**2. Substances movement:** Remember that osmosis refers specifically to the movement of water, while diffusion refers to the movement of other substances.

## Exam Techniques & Tips

- When asked to label a cell diagram, make sure to only label what is asked.
- Revise the differences and similarities between plant and animal cells.
- Be prepared to explain how substances move in and out of cells. 

## Practice Questions

1. Name three organelles found in both plant and animal cells. (Foundation)
2. Describe the process of mitosis. (Foundation)
3. Explain how a nerve cell is specialised. (Intermediate)
4. Describe how substances move in and out of cells. (Intermediate)
5. Explain the importance of cell differentiation and give an example. (Challenge)
