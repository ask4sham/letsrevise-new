# Algebra - Revision Notes

## Overview
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. It's an essential part of maths at KS3 and forms the foundation for many advanced topics in higher levels. Understanding algebra will help you solve complex problems and understand the mathematical relationships between different quantities.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this revision, you should be able to:
- Understand and use algebraic notation
- Perform basic algebraic operations
- Solve simple algebraic equations
- Understand and use the concept of a variable
- Form and manipulate expressions and equations

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- **Variable**: A symbol, usually a letter, that represents one or more numbers.
- **Coefficient**: The numerical factor of a term that contains a variable.
- **Term**: A single number, a variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together.
- **Expression**: A mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables and operational symbols.
- **Equation**: A mathematical statement where two expressions are equal.
  
## Detailed Explanations
### Algebraic Notation
- Algebraic notation uses letters to represent numbers. For example, the expression `2a` represents `2 times a number`.
- **Example**: If `a = 3`, then `2a = 2 * 3 = 6`.
  
### Algebraic Operations
- You can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on algebraic expressions.
- **Example**: If `a = 3` and `b = 2`, then `a + b = 3 + 2 = 5`.

### Solving Equations
- To solve an equation means to find the value of the variable.
- **Example**: In the equation `2x = 6`, the value of `x` is `3` because `2 * 3 = 6`

## Worked Examples
### Example 1
Problem: Solve the equation `3x = 9`.
Solution:
- Divide both sides of the equation by `3` to find `x`.
- `x = 9 / 3`
- `x = 3`

### Example 2
Problem: Simplify the expression `4a + 3a`.
Solution:
- Combine like terms.
- `4a + 3a = 7a`

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- **Mistake**: Forgetting to perform operations on both sides of the equation when solving.
- **Solution**: Always remember to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain the equality.

## Exam Techniques & Tips
- Always show your working out, as you can get marks for the process as well as the correct answer.
- For questions asking you to 'show that', make sure you demonstrate each step of your working out.

## Practice Questions
1. Simplify the expression `5b - 2b` (Foundation)
2. Solve the equation `4y = 16` (Foundation)
3. Simplify the expression `3c + 2c - c` (Intermediate)
4. Solve the equation `5z = 15` (Intermediate)
5. If `3d = 12`, what is the value of `6d`? (Challenge)

## Related Topics & Next Steps
After mastering algebra, you may want to move on to equations and inequalities or functions. Algebra forms the basis for many other topics in mathematics, so a solid understanding will benefit you in your future studies.
